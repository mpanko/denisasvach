    content: "*A Lyric of Machines* investigates the transformation of soundscapes
      from the mechanical world to digital environments, evident in both urban
      spaces and homes. This evolution has created new auditory experiences that
      shape our spatial perception differently than two decades ago. Artist
      Katerina Sedy delves into the world of sound generators, using recordings
      of machines, traffic, and industrial noise, which are then graphically
      translated into melody. Mezzosoprano Eliška Zajícová brings this abstract
      composition to life, interpreting rhythmic, often overlooked sounds in a
      classical manner. Denisa Svachova designed a costume from a work jumpsuit
      and crafted a vest from old cables, amplifying the visual and thematic
      elements of the piece."
