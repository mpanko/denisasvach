      Back Into the Desert places the audience in the midst of an expansive, unending desert, where two participants find themselves simultaneously free yet constrained by external commands. Viewers are compelled to decide who to follow in 360-degree video, as it's impossible to observe both at once, enhancing the interactive and participatory aspects of the experience. The video was created in the Moroccan Sahara, where Jan Pancocha and I listened to a voice-over by Anna Hovorkova for the first time and filmed it with a 360-degree camera.
