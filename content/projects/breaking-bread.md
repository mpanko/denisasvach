      Breaking Bread is a video performance exploring the theme of manipulation
      and the diverse ways individuals interpret and react to the same commands.


      The performance involves two participants seated on opposite sides of a round table, separated by a wall. Although physically and mentally isolated, they remain aware of each other's presence. Both participants receive identical instructions through headphones, beginning with an awareness of their own bodies. As the performance progresses, the commands escalate from simple motivational cues to increasingly absurd directives, highlighting the variations in human response.
