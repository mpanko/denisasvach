      A dancer, dressed in a round table-shaped costume, offers sweet candy kisses to passersby and, in return, asks for photos of their hometown. 


      The buffet is part of the larger project Do You Mind If I Join You, which explores the experiences of expats—people living outside their native country, either temporarily or for an extended period. Through this concept, I create a series of interviews and performances that delve into themes of belonging, cultural exchange, and the feeling of being an outsider.

      The performance focused on exploring contrasts between movement styles, cultural references, and audience expectations. We combined contrasting dance forms, such as vogue and Czech folk dance, to create unpredictable situations, reflecting the experience of adapting to unfamiliar environments. Central to the piece was the Buffet costume, serving as both a scenographic and conceptual element.
