      A dancer, dressed in a round table-shaped costume, offers sweet candy kisses to passersby and, in return, asks for photos of their hometown. 


      The buffet is part of the larger project Do You Mind If I Join You, which explores the experiences of expats—people living outside their native country, either temporarily or for an extended period. Through this concept, I create a series of interviews and performances that delve into themes of belonging, cultural exchange, and the feeling of being an outsider.
