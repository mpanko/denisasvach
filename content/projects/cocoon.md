      *Cocoon* is a site-specific textile installation created for a traditional Indonesian gazebo called pendopo. The piece comes to life through the interaction of two participants, who generate a spatial composition by wrapping and unwrapping fabric around themselves and the pendopo's pillars. One participant sits in the center, hidden and wrapped in fabric on a wheeled object, while the other winds the fabric around themselves and pulls the object to one side, prompting the seated participant to emerge and unravel.
