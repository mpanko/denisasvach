    content: Collecting Addictions exhibition delves into the passion for collecting
      and the irresistible need to accumulate and archive common, often
      unnecessary items. Denisa Svachova uses ready-made techniques to elevate
      found objects into artifacts of artistic value, recycling and
      recontextualizing mundane items. Her focus lies on artifacts from the
      pharmaceutical and tobacco industries, highlighting the massive profits
      these sectors generate within global consumer chains. Svachova’s work
      contrasts with Peter Valiska-Timečko’s conceptually driven critique of the
      pharmaceutical industry, where he exposes aggressive marketing tactics and
      the corruption of scientific integrity. Together, they offer distinct yet
      complementary artistic languages, unified by the theme of “collecting as a
      dependency”.
