      Collecting Addictions exhibition delves into the passion for collecting and the irresistible need to accumulate and archive common, often unnecessary items. Denisa Svachova uses ready-made techniques to elevate found objects into artifacts of artistic value, recycling and recontextualizing mundane items. Her focus lies on artifacts from the pharmaceutical and tobacco industries, highlighting the massive profits these sectors generate within global consumer chains. Svachova’s work contrasts with Peter Valiska-Timečko’s conceptually driven critique of the pharmaceutical industry, where he exposes aggressive marketing tactics and the corruption of scientific integrity. Together, they offer distinct yet complementary artistic languages, unified by the theme of “collecting as a dependency”.


      The exhibition was presented at GAVU gallery in Prague, Czech Republic in 2013.
