      This work explores the contrast between protection and vulnerability.
      Under the name Double-Sided Structure, I created a costume and an object
      that a person can step into, offering a sense of security. Both the
      costume and object feature distinctive hoods, highlighting the contrast
      between softness and discomfort. Inside, the materials are soft and
      comfortable, while the outer surfaces are sharp and uninviting. The object
      combines soft white cotton with perforated metal mesh, and the costume
      uses the same cotton alongside plastic netting.


      The Double-Sided Structure project was created during my student exchange at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague, Czech Republic, in 2015.
