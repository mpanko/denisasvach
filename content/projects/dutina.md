      The video work DUTINA, created by Richard Blasko, examines the conditioning and significance of visual heritage through the lens of a lace mask. It delves into the performativity between the inner and outer realms. His main focus is on the friction and parallel nature of these entities. He questions their intersection through video installations that explore blending the fictional and the real.
