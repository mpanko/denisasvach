      The video work DUTINA, created by Richard Blasko, examines the
      conditioning and significance of visual heritage through the lens of a
      lace mask. It delves into the performativity between the inner and outer
      realms. His main focus is on the friction and parallel nature of these
      entities. He questions their intersection through video installations that
      explore blending the fictional and the real.



      The video work Dutina was exhibited at Richard Bla≈°ko's solo show "31" at Modern Animals Gallery in 2024.
