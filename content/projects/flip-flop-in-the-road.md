      *Flip-flop in the Road* was created in response to the pollution and
      disorder I encountered in Yogyakarta. When I first arrived in Indonesia, I
      was shocked by the environment people lived in. Trash was thrown
      carelessly on the ground, waste bins were a rare sight, and littering was
      common, even from moving vehicles. Among the debris lying in the middle of
      roads were abandoned flip-flops, lost by motorcyclists, often left
      untouched for weeks. These forgotten sandals reminded me of lifeless
      bodies, discarded alongside heaps of waste.


      As a statement that even discarded items deserve a more honorable end than simply rotting away, I performed thirteen happenings. At each site where a flip-flop lay, I buried it and placed a cross with a photo, marking its final resting place. I chose to focus on flip-flops because each has a unique character, evoking a sense of empathy and the story of its loss. The reasons for abandonment could be as simple as a mishap or the result of a tragic accident. For residents, these flip-flops are also a somber reminder of the devastating earthquake in 2006, when the streets were littered with them in overwhelming numbers.
