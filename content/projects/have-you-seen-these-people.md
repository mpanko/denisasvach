      The title refers to the phrase commonly used in an unfortunate case of someone close gone missing. Nothing but a little bit of hope or despair, rather, remains. Our approach is the exact opposite: we do not look for anyone who disappeared, we are curious about the people we discovered. We know each other from the found film negatives. A series of questions arise immediately: Who are these people? What do they do? What are their destinies? Are they still alive? Can we meet? Do you know them? Have you seen these people?


      *Have You Seen These People?* is a photography exhibition featuring found film negatives, presenting the work of four artists who reflect on the serendipity of discovering these images. The project questions whether it was mere chance that led us to these specific negatives or if something deeper connects us to them. Alongside the exhibition, we created a catalog with photographs and the stories of how each negative was found.
