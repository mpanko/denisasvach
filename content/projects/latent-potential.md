      Latent Potential is a sound installation created with Julie Lupačová, where repetitive background sounds serve as a template for visual elements in the space. Initially appearing random, the objects around visitors gradually reveal their deliberate placement, each tied to the sound composition and its hidden stories. This project explores the interplay between sound and visuals, using auditory cues to shape a narrative within the installation. 


      Presented at the Future Ready exhibition, Campus Hybernská, in 2018.
