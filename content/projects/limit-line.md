description: A performance exploring physical and mental limits through body
  movements synchronized with a metronome, reflecting the overwhelming
  experience of trying to manage too many tasks at once.

      For Limit Line performance (2017), I created constructions that mirrored body movement in strict verticals and horizontals. The performance began with the steady rhythm of a metronome, which I initially followed while mimicking the shapes of the structures. Over time, I began to increase my speed, attempting to handle more movements at once. As the tempo became overwhelming, I turned off the metronome.
