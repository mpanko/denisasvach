    content: Limit Line is an installation that examines the concept of boundaries and thresholds in both physical and conceptual spaces. Through a series of linear interventions in the gallery space, this project invites viewers to consider the nature of limits and how they shape our perception and movement.

    content: The installation uses a combination of materials including tape, light, and sound to create visible and invisible boundaries that visitors must navigate. This work challenges our understanding of space and encourages reflection on the limits we encounter and create in our daily lives.
