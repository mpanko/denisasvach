    content: For *Limit Line* performance (2017), I created constructions that
      mirrored body movement in strict verticals and horizontals. The
      performance began with the steady rhythm of a metronome, which I initially
      followed while mimicking the shapes of the structures. Over time, I began
      to increase my speed, attempting to handle more movements at once. As the
      tempo became overwhelming, I turned off the metronome.
