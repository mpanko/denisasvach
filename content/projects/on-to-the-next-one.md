      The setting of the third year of the *ARTakeaway* project are the premises of metro stations Můstek and Muzeum in Prague. In light of the events of the last two years, we've decided to focus on utopian and naïve worlds. Just like futurism projected worlds to come dominated by technology, we would like to focus on future worlds reigned by the principle of harmony and functional community life - we mainly draw inspiration from the animal and plant kingdoms. Metro stations can also be used as a shelter in case of potential catastrophe, but we want to use them to create a world from which you don't want to hide.
