  individual sheets of paper, each representing one day of my father's smoking
  habit, exploring repetition, memory, and personal ritual through everyday
  objects.

      Smoking a cigarette, as the act itself, has become a source of inspiration
      for many projects for me. It is traditionally used as a film symbol, but I
      have tried to explore how diffrent media such as installation or
      performance can elaborate on it. This ritual requires a certain movement
      of the body in the same sequence. The smokers behave very naturally, but
      one can notice their individuality in different approaches to the
      different parts of this ritual. I have observed and documented the
      smokers. My aim was to create as accurate description of each person's
      individual approach to smoking and capture the autenticity of personal
      approach to it. For several years I also took pictures of my own
      cigarettes that I smoke. I used these photos for performance In The Heat
      Of 7', 2017.


      In the work Pack a Day (2014), I focused on cigarette packs. At the beginning I collected all the boxes. On some of the boxes I have found various handwritten messages forgotten cigarettes, papers or tickets. However, my main focus was on the boxes from one particluar person, my father. He used to smoke pack of cigarettes a day. He created this habit to control his consumption and regulate how much he smokes. The particular consistency of this habit has inspired me to create a calendar from each box that he smoked everyday.

      Each sheet of paper is made from a single cigarette pack, and to make my father's "a pack a day" rule clear, each page has a date stamped on it. I created the paper using the carpet technique, which really achieved the effect of each paper being made from just one cigarette box. Depending on which box I used, the paper is a slightly different colour and texture.
