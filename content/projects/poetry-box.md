      The installation invited three poets—Robert Jaworek, Filip Trunkat, and František Sevcik—to read their poems locked in the box, without direct contact with the audience. Isolated inside the mirrored space, the poets had no way of knowing the audience's reactions, devoid of the usual feedback from eye contact or visible cues.


      Poetry Box was presented at Garáž gallery in Zlin, Czech Republic in 2014.
