    content: Saudade is a game with strict boundaries in which imagery and longing
      go hand in hand. It’s a puffed-out void that bursts and hits you right
      into your chest. It’s whispering at the edge of actuality. Saudade – the
      sensation of lacking, grief for something beloved that disappeared or has
      never been here. Solo by a dancer and choreographer, Alica Minárová, who
      through the character of a stripper searches for natural sensuality that
      doesn’t deprive the female body of dignity by showing it.
