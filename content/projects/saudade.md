      *Saudade* is a game with strict boundaries in which imagery and longing go hand in hand. It’s a puffed-out void that bursts and hits you right into your chest. It’s whispering at the edge of actuality. Saudade – the sensation of lacking, grief for something beloved that disappeared or has never been here. Solo by a dancer and choreographer, Alica Minar, who through the character of a stripper searches for natural sensuality that doesn’t deprive the female body of dignity by showing it.
