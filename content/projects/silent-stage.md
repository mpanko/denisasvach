      *Silent Stage* is an immersive sound installation that provided a peaceful escape from the festival atmosphere. We recorded the natural soundscape of the location days before the event and created a small gazebo-like structure facing away from the festival. Visitors could sit, take in the view, and listen to the serene, original sounds of the site on high-quality headphones, experiencing a calming time shift away from the surrounding chaos.Â 



      *Silent Stage* was part of the Mismas music festival in Bojkovice, Czech Republic in 2017
