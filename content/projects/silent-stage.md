      Silent Stage is an immersive sound installation that provides a peaceful escape from the festival atmosphere. We recorded the natural soundscape of the location days before the event and created a small gazebo-like structure facing away from the festival. Visitors could sit, take in the view, and listen to the serene, original sounds of the site on high-quality headphones, experiencing a calming time shift away from the surrounding chaos.
