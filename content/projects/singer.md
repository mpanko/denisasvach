      A Singer sewing machine transformed into a musical instrument as part of a performance evening at Sihlquai 253. While sewing a long red stripe, I used a transducer pickup to capture the machine's sounds, modifying them with three effect pedals. One foot worked the sewing pedal, while the other created rhythmic variations, turning the act of sewing into a live sound performance.
