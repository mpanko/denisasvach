      *Spinning Interview* centers on the theme of home, seamlessly blending the activity of spinning with interview-style discussions. The project offers a contemplative exploration of personal narratives surrounding the notion of home. It leverages real-time speech-to-text technology and bespoke musical compositions to create an engaging and immersive experience for both participants and observers.


      Visitors were invited individually to step behind a semi-transparent curtain, where instruction cards guided them to keep turning around while answering questions into a microphone. Other visitors could observe the responder through the curtain and read the answers displayed in real-time on a screen and website.
