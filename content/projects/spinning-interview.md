    content: Spinning Interview is a performance-based project that challenges traditional notions of communication and perspective. In this work, participants engage in a conversation while seated on a slowly rotating platform, creating a constantly shifting physical and psychological dynamic.

    content: The project explores how physical movement and changing viewpoints affect our ability to communicate and understand one another. By introducing an element of disorientation, Spinning Interview encourages participants and viewers to reconsider their assumptions about interpersonal interactions and the role of context in shaping our perceptions.
