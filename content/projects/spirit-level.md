      *Spirit Level* is a self-service performance inviting visitors to
      experience it as participants or observers. Active participants follow
      audio instructions via headphones, guiding them through simple balance
      exercises with interactive objects. Observers, in contrast, engage with a
      different sensory experience, witnessing the unfolding actions.


      I explore the relationship between natural movement and choreography, and the specific spatial installations determine the scope of this research. Within their limits, I create different situations through the techniques of contemporary dance, theater, and performance and actively involve the viewer. I map the boundaries of how far the viewer is willing to be drawn into the manipulative play of normative instructions conflicting with meditative moments and how his or her tolerance is bent with the knowledge of the other participants' compliance.


      I created the project *Spirit Level* as my final work at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, Czech Republic as part of the exhibition Another Place in 2018.
