    content: Spirit Level is a series that delves into the concept of balance, both
      in the physical world and in our inner lives. Through a variety of media,
      this project examines how we strive for and maintain equilibrium in an
      ever-changing environment.

    content: The installation incorporates suspended elements that respond to air
      currents, creating a dynamic interplay between stability and motion.
      Visitors are invited to reflect on their own sense of balance as they
      navigate the space.
