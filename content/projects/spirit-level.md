      *[](https://soundcloud.com/tvaryshapes/spirit-level?si=3153bf04d67b4755b8b68827d0cf4f6b&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)

      Spirit Level* is a self-service performance inviting visitors to experience it as participants or observers. Active participants follow audio instructions via headphones, guiding them through simple balance exercises with interactive objects. Observers, in contrast, engage with a different sensory experience, witnessing the unfolding actions.


      I explore the relationship between natural movement and choreography, and the specific spatial installations determine the scope of this research. Within their limits, I create different situations through the techniques of contemporary dance, theater, and performance and actively involve the viewer. I map the boundaries of how far the viewer is willing to be drawn into the manipulative play of normative instructions conflicting with meditative moments and how his or her tolerance is bent with the knowledge of the other participants' compliance.

    content: "For *Prag_Kassel: Hybrid Inconvenience* exhibition I created *Spirit
      Level* in four languages—English, German, Italian, and French—each quietly
      over-translated into Czech. The exhibition examined the symbolic potential
      of the Munich Agreement (1938) through contemporary visual art."
