      Together with the audience, three dancers go through Treatment of
      Remembering, in the language of contemporary dance and physical theatre.
      The theme of the performance is based on the relationship to nature and
      the difficult development of the state of the environment. The performance
      is set in an indeterminate context, whose space evokes a feeling of the
      absence of real contact with nature.


      The premiere took place on October 5, 2020, at PONEC â€“ Theatre for Dance, Prague, Czech Republic
