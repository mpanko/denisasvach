      White Tubes encourages visitors to engage physically: sitting, climbing,
      or lying down to experience the space from a different perspective. The
      installation shifts the perception of space, stripping away unnecessary
      elements to focus solely on the raw forms. This spatial arrangement
      created an intimate yet public interaction, exploring minimalist ideas of
      presence and direct engagement with the environment.


      Presented at the MONUMENT I exhibition (NoD Gallery, Prague, Czech Repubic) in 2015.
