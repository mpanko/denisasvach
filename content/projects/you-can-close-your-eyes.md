      The *You Can Close Your Eyes* project focuses on revealing the hidden layers of a place through collective dreaming. During October 2021, passers-by engage in the process of imagination—dreaming, shaping, and firing a mythical animal inside a mysterious white box, a site of concentrated perception. The project is based on an in-depth exploration of the environment near the Martiňák pond. Its layers are uncovered through personal encounters with the landscape, local people, and culture. The scientific research site becomes an experimental laboratory where the artist develops methods to use natural materials (clay, sand, wood, water) to transform findings into material artifacts and to weave the contemporary myth of the place. The installation is a participatory project inviting the public to join the experience. The accompanying workshops, Listening to the Wild, focus on perceiving and transcending the boundaries between natural and urban landscapes and includes experiments with environmental sound recordings.
